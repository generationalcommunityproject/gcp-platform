# The Generational Community Project (GCP)

## Early Notes

- We want to do a Project for Social Good
- It's difficult to quantify corporate harm, where do we start?
  - You start by asking the community to identify issues...
  - Companies can acknowledge issues and approach the community for solutions
  - The community and other companies can propose solutions
  - Solutions can be vetted by the community
  - Contractors can approach the community with proposals
  - Proposals will get funded
- The assumption being, a corporation may be inadvertently doing harm, and wish to correct it.
  - Involving the community, eliminating bureaucracy, corporate responsibility, partnering with the community to solve problems.
- The two kinds of harm we'd like to address are social and ecological harm.

## Mission Statement
